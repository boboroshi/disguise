<h2>About</h2>

<h3>What is Toupee?</h3>

<p>Toupee is a visual framework built with advanced technologies like HTML5 and CSS3</p>


<h3>What is Mustache?</h3>
<p>Mustache can be used for HTML, config files, source code - anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.</p>

<p>We call it "logic-less" because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead there are only tags. Some tags are replaced with a value, some nothing, and others a series of values.</p>


<h3>What is Disguise?</h3>
<p>Disguise is the demo app that was created to show the powerful combination of Toupee and Mustache.</p>
