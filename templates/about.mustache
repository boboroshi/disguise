<h2>What is Toupee?</h2>
<p>I have found myself creating patterns over and over while developing websites. Over that time I have saved those patterns and turned them into a lean, customizable framework. That framework is Toupee. It adds a simple customizable visual layer to your code while using advanced technologies like HTML5 and CSS3. It can be used for a prototyping or pushed all the way to production. Stylesheets can be removed or added, everything is loosely joined and highly customizable. Give it a try, your feedback is welcome. Feel free to email or add an issue to the <a href="http://github.com/marchdoe/disguise">github repository</a>.</p>

<h3>The philosophy</h3> 

<p><strong>All sites have three visual layers</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Structural layer</strong> - It's the barebones style-set to get something going.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>reset.css</li>
      <li>structure.css</li>
      <li>typography.css</li>
      <li>forms.css</li>
      <li>modules.css</li>
      <li>buttons.css</li>
    </ul>
  <li><strong>Base design layer</strong> - The first visual layer. It would include brand, brand colors, specific styles related to that of your site design</li>
  <li><strong>Application specific layer</strong> (optional)- Lets say that two or three applications fall under your brand, you can create application specific styles in this layer.</li>
</ul>

<p>This was designed to be flexible and customizable. If you don't want to use all the stylesheets, you don't have to. Or lets say you want to structure your layout differently, just replace the provided css in structure.css with your layout of choice.</p>

<h2>What is Mustache?</h2>
<p>Mustache can be used for HTML, config files, source code - anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.</p>

<p>"logic-less" because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead there are only tags. Some tags are replaced with a value, some nothing, and others a series of values.</p>


<h2>What is Disguise?</h2>
<p>Disguise is the <a href="http://disguise.heroku.com">demo app</a> that was created to show the powerful combination of Toupee and Mustache.</p>
