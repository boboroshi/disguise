What is disguise?




What is toupee?

The wireframe layer is the barebones style-set to get something going.
It is comprised of reset.css, grid.css, typography.css, forms.css
button.css and modules.css

The base layer is the first visual layer. It would include brand,
brand colors, specific styles related to that of your site design

The application layer is optional. Lets say that two or three
applications fall under your brand, you can create application
specific styles in this layer.

What I generally do is symlink (never was able to get git submodules
to work correctly) in the toupee assets (unless there is an
application layer, then I include that in the app itself).




What is Mustache?
