WORK IN PROGRESS NEEDS BETTER DOCUMENTATION AND EXAMPLES -- FEEL FREE TO CHECK IT OUT THOUGH

If you like what you see but see something wrong, feel free to add an issue

h1. Toupee + Mustache = Disguise
What is disguise you ask? It is a quick demo I setup to show the functionality of Toupee.


h2. What makes up Toupee?

The "wireframe" layer 
It's the barebones style-set to get something going.
It is comprised of reset.css, grid.css, typography.css, forms.css
button.css and modules.css

The "base style" layer 
The first visual layer. It would include brand,
brand colors, specific styles related to that of your site design

The "application layer" (optional)
Lets say that two or three applications fall under your brand, you can create application specific styles in this layer.


h2. What is {{Mustache}}?

Mustache is a logic-less templating system for HTML, config files, anything. 


h2. Installation
Grab your Toupee -- http://github.com/marchdoe/toupee

What I generally do is symlink (sorry was never was able to get git submodules
to work correctly) in the toupee assets into the public folder.

and now for your mustache
- rubygems
- $ gem install mustache


...and now you have a Disguise
